              ighered is a unique community-driven website that aims to connect
              recruiters from startups with small teams that have had
              difficulties finding qualified web3 candidates for their
              organizations. The platform also helps candidates looking for jobs
              within the web3 community, who have struggled to find employment
              due to either lack of skills or inadequate ability to express
              themselves fully. The website connects recruiters to a database of
              qualified, vetted candidates, making it easier for them to find
              suitable candidates for their open positions. Additionally,
              Highered helps candidates learn blockchain code and integrate
              themselves into the web3 community through qualifying interviews
              and assessments. This creates a win-win scenario where recruiters
              get access to a pool of talented candidates, and candidates get an
              opportunity to develop their skills and showcase their expertise.
              The platform connects senior web3 developers with junior web3
              developers, as well as those who are looking to enter the web3
              community, for digital informational qualifying interviews. It
              also allows developers to test themselves against other community
              member-created problem sets and assessments. This creates a
              supportive environment where developers can learn from each other
              and develop their skills faster. The ultimate goal of Highered is
              to grow the talent pool within the web3 community and connect
              qualified candidates with startups faster. This would help bridge
              the gap between recruiters and candidates, making it easier for
              startups to find the right talent and for candidates to find the
              right job opportunities. In summary, Highered is a
              community-driven website that helps to connect recruiters with
              talented web3 candidates while also helping candidates develop
              their skills and showcase their expertise. The platform fosters a
              supportive environment that encourages collaboration and skill
              development, ultimately growing the talent pool within the web3
              community and connecting qualified candidates with startups
              faster.
